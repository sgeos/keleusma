# Self-Hosting Wire-Format Serialization — Scoping

> **Navigation**: [Decisions](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

Scoping for the Order-1 residual "self-host wire-format serialization". Probed 2026-08-03.

Status: **SCOPED. The roadmap's description is INCOMPLETE and its cost is understated.**

## The correction

`V0_2_X_ROADMAP.md` describes the item as: "The framing header, operand-pool encoding, parity, and
CRC trailer must move into Keleusma so the emitted artifact is produced end to end by the self-hosted
path." That enumeration omits the dominant cost.

`module_to_wire_bytes` (`src/wire_format.rs` ~1591) produces four regions:

| Region | Encoding | Self-hostable? |
|---|---|---|
| Framing header | 64 fixed bytes | Yes, mechanical |
| Opcode stream | 4-byte records via `encode_op` (~206 lines) | Yes, mechanical |
| Operand pool | 8-byte flat entries | Yes, mechanical |
| CRC trailer | CRC-32, reflected, poly in `crc32` | Yes, ~15 lines |
| **Auxiliary body** | **`rkyv::to_bytes`** | **NO — see below** |

**The auxiliary body is rkyv-archived**, and it carries everything except the opcode stream and
operand pool: per-chunk metadata (name, constants, struct templates, local/param counts, block type,
param types, debug pool), enum layouts, signatures, native return shapes, native names, entry point,
data layout, the word/addr/float width fields, the WCET/WCMU header, flags, shared and private data
sizes, and the schema hash.

rkyv is a ZERO-COPY ARCHIVE format: relative pointers, alignment and padding rules, a resolver
protocol, and its own versioning. Reproducing its byte layout in Keleusma is not "serialization" in
the sense the roadmap implies — it is reimplementing a third-party archival format byte-for-byte, with
the byte-identical oracle demanding exact agreement including padding. That is disproportionate, and
it is also FRAGILE: an rkyv upgrade would silently invalidate the Keleusma implementation.

**Therefore "self-host wire-format serialization" as literally stated is NOT a bounded increment, and
it is not the cheapest Order-1 item.** The earlier recommendation to start here (recorded in
`REVERSE_PROMPT.md` and `HANDOFF.md` on 2026-08-03) was based on the roadmap's enumeration and is
withdrawn.

## What IS bounded

The four non-rkyv regions are mechanical and have a clean byte-identity oracle: emit them from
Keleusma and compare against the same regions of the reference's buffer. Suggested slicing, smallest
first, each independently verifiable:

1. **CRC-32.** ~15 lines, a pure function over a byte range. Trivially oracle-checked against
   `crate::bytecode::crc32` on random and edge-case buffers. Good first slice to establish the
   byte-emission harness.
2. **The opcode stream and operand pool.** The meaty part, and exactly what the roadmap calls
   "operand-pool encoding". codegen.kel already carries an internal op encoding whose tag values ARE
   the opcode ids (`getfield` 47, `getindex` 49, `gettuplefield` 53, ...), so the mapping to 4-byte
   records is close to what it already computes. Verify against `encode_op` over every op form,
   including the pool-spill cases.
3. **The framing header.** 64 fixed bytes; needs the region lengths from 1 and 2 plus the aux length.

After those three, the artifact is Keleusma-produced EXCEPT the aux body, which remains host-supplied
as an opaque byte block. That is an honest partial result and should be described that way — it does
NOT meet the Order-1 gate's "no Rust scaffold borrow" wording.

## The open question for the operator

Fully self-hosting the artifact requires a decision this plan cannot make: either reimplement rkyv's
layout in Keleusma (disproportionate and fragile), or **change the wire format** so the aux body uses
an encoding the self-hosted compiler can produce — which is a format change, and therefore a
`BYTECODE_VERSION` question and an operator decision under the standing rules.

Until that is decided, treat Order 1 as reachable only in part, and prefer the other two remainders
(the monomorphizer, then the type checker) for closing it.

## Note on the monomorphizer

Probed at the same time: the `.kel` stage sources use no generics (the four `impl`/`trait` hits in
parse.kel are its own parser code for those keywords, not uses). Monomorphization is therefore
IDENTITY over the self-hosting subset, which is why the pipeline omits the pass entirely and still
matches the reference byte-for-byte. Self-hosting it would tick the box without changing any output.
Its real cost arrives only with full-language generics (Workstream F), so its value here is formal
rather than functional — worth knowing before it is picked as "the cheapest".
