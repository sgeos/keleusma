# Backlog Decisions

> **Navigation**: [Decisions](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

Deferred decisions for future consideration. These are explicitly out of scope for the current development phase.

## ~~B1. Hindley-Milner type inference~~ (Resolved)

Hindley-Milner is in place in `src/typecheck.rs`.

Foundation. The `Type` enum carries a `Var(u32)` variant. `Subst` maps type variables to types. `unify` implements Robinson's algorithm with the occurs check. `VarGen` allocates fresh type variables. The typing context carries the substitution and variable allocator across a function check.

Integration. `types_compatible` calls `unify` and records relationships in the substitution. Unannotated positions that previously returned `Type::Unknown` now allocate fresh type variables, so constraints propagate across let bindings, function calls, returns, and conditional branches. The substitution-application pass at end of `check_function` resolves locals to their inferred types and rolls back per-function variables so cross-function checking remains independent.

Generic functions (B2) reuse the same machinery: each generic call site instantiates the function's abstract type variables with fresh per-call variables before unifying with actual arguments.

The `Type::Unknown` sentinel is retained as a permissive transitional anchor for runtime-only dispatch positions (such as native function call results without declared signatures). Removing it would require declaring native signatures, which is recorded as future work in the typecheck module documentation.

## ~~B2. Generic type parameters and trait bounds~~ (Resolved for declaration, bound enforcement, and impl validation)

Generic functions, structs, enums, traits, trait bounds, and impl signature validation are all in place. Impl methods register as compiled chunks under their mangled name `Trait::TypeHead::method`.

Surface syntax. `fn name<T, U>(args) -> ret { body }`, `struct Name<T, U> { fields }`, `enum Name<T, U> { variants }`, `trait Name { fn method(args) -> ret; }`, `impl Trait for Type { method definitions }`, and `fn name<T: Trait1 + Trait2>(...)` for bounds.

AST. `FunctionDef`, `StructDef`, and `EnumDef` carry `type_params: Vec<TypeParam>`. `TypeParam` carries `bounds: Vec<String>`. `TraitDef`, `ImplBlock`, and `TraitMethodSig` are top-level declarations. `TypeExpr::Named` carries `Vec<TypeExpr>` for generic instantiation references.

Type checking. Generic declarations record abstract `Type::Var` per type parameter. Call sites instantiate fresh per-call variables, unify with arguments, and validate trait bounds against the `impls` registry. Impl method signatures are validated against the trait declaration: arity match, name match. Each impl method is also registered as a compiled chunk under its mangled name `Trait::TypeHead::method`.

Compilation and runtime. Keleusma's runtime-tagged `Value` enum dispatches polymorphically. Generic chunks work for any concrete type. Impl methods are emitted as regular chunks under mangled names. Receiver-style method dispatch (`x.method(args)` resolving to the impl for `x`'s type) requires either monomorphization-rewriting at compile time or runtime lookup; the parser does not yet have a method-call syntax distinct from struct field access.

The remaining future work tracked under this entry.

- Method call surface syntax (`x.method(args)`). Parser change plus resolution. Pairs naturally with monomorphization which makes the receiver type concrete.

## B2.4 Compile-time monomorphization

Monomorphization specializes each generic chunk per concrete type instantiation, eliminating runtime tag dispatch for generic operations and providing a path for trait method dispatch.

Design phases.

Phase 1. Call-graph traversal from `main`. Walk the program from the entry point, following calls. At each call to a generic function, record the concrete `Vec<Type>` that satisfies the call's type parameters. Each unique `(function, type_args)` pair is one specialization.

Phase 2. Specialization generation. For each `(function, type_args)` pair, clone the function's body and substitute the abstract type-parameter variables with the concrete types throughout. The specialization name is the original function name suffixed with the canonical encoding of the type args.

Phase 3. Trait method resolution within specializations. After substitution, every use of a trait method on a known-concrete type rewrites to the impl's mangled name (`Trait::TypeHead::method`). The runtime dispatch becomes a direct chunk-index call.

Phase 4. Output. The compiler emits only the monomorphic specializations. The original generic functions are dropped from the bytecode. Calls in the program are rewritten to point to the specializations.

Implementation considerations.

- Generic structs and enums are similarly monomorphized. The runtime representation can stay tag-based for now (`Type::Struct(name, args)`); future work could specialize the runtime representation per instantiation.
- Polymorphic recursion is rejected because it produces unbounded specializations.
- Caching the specializations by `(function, type_args)` ensures finite output.
- The substitution applied is the function's signature substitution at the call site, captured by the type checker.

Estimated implementation effort. Four to eight hours for generic functions; trait method dispatch within specializations adds two to four hours. Generic structs and enums are roughly equivalent to functions.

This is the next major language work. Without monomorphization, trait methods cannot be invoked through a clean surface syntax, and the runtime pays a tag-dispatch cost on every operation.

## B3. Closures or anonymous functions

Closures or anonymous functions would enable higher-order programming patterns such as callbacks and inline transformations. Deferred to keep the VM simple. Multiheaded function dispatch serves as a partial alternative for pattern-based dispatch.

## ~~B4. Hot code swap implementation~~ (Resolved as R29)

Hot code swap is implemented through `Vm::replace_module`. The host calls it between a `VmState::Reset` and the next `call`. The new module is verified before replacement. The host supplies an initial data segment instance whose length must match the new module's declared slot count. Frames and stack are cleared so the next `call` starts the new module's entry point. The same mechanism supports forward update and rollback. See R29 in [RESOLVED.md](./RESOLVED.md).

## ~~B5. Structural verification implementation~~ (Resolved as R22, R23)

Structural verification is implemented. See R22 and R23 in [RESOLVED.md](./RESOLVED.md).

## B5b. Static string discipline extensions

String values use the two-string-type discipline of `Value::StaticStr` and `Value::DynStr` with the host-owned arena boundary type `Value::KStr` for stale-pointer detection. The minimum coherent design is in place. Anything beyond, namely surface-language string concatenation, formatting, slicing, or other variable-cost operations, is deferred. Keleusma is not a value-add for string work, so further string features are recorded here for future consideration only.

## B6. String interpolation

String interpolation is not needed for a control language. Keleusma scripts primarily produce structured enum values and numeric outputs, not formatted strings. If formatting is needed, the host can provide native functions for string construction.

## B7. Error propagation through yield

Allowing yield to return `Result<T, E>` so the host can signal errors to the script would enable bidirectional error handling. Deferred due to type system complexity and the need to define error recovery semantics at the language level.

## B8. VM allocation model

Should the VM allocate per-script or share an arena across all active scripts? Currently each VM instance is independent with its own heap allocations. A shared arena could reduce allocation overhead for hosts running many concurrent scripts, but would add complexity to lifetime management.

## ~~B9. Hot update of yielded static strings~~ (Resolved structurally)

The lifetime concern is structurally avoided in the current implementation. `Value::from_const_archived` materializes archived `StaticStr` constants into owned `String` values at the moment they are pushed onto the operand stack. Yielded values that contain a `Value::StaticStr` therefore hold owned heap data that is independent of the bytecode buffer. A hot update that swaps the buffer through `Vm::replace_module` does not affect the host's retained yield value because the string bytes were already copied out at the lift boundary.

Eager resolution at the lift boundary is the resolution path B from the original design. The trade-off is a heap allocation per `StaticStr` push, which is acceptable for the dialogue surface where yielded values cross out of the VM. Future zero-copy yield paths that retain `&ArchivedString` references in `Value` would re-introduce the concern; if they are pursued, the host-responsibility model from path A is the alternative.

## B11. Per-op decode optimization for zero-copy execution

The zero-copy execution path reads each instruction through `op_from_archived(&chunk.ops[ip])`, which performs a discriminant match per fetch. The cost is one match arm and a small payload copy on hot loops. For very hot bytecode this could become measurable.

Two candidate optimizations.

A. Cache a decoded `Vec<Op>` per chunk at VM construction. Hot path becomes a direct slice index. Cost: heap allocation proportional to chunk size at construction; defeats zero-copy for the operation slice but preserves zero-copy for constants and string data.

B. Specialize the dispatch loop on a small set of hot opcodes through a separate dispatch table generated from the archived form. Cost: more complex codegen; benefit depends on opcode distribution in real workloads.

Deferred until profiling identifies the dispatch as a hot path on real workloads. The current implementation is correct and the cost is bounded by the structural verifier's per-op accounting, so this is a performance enhancement rather than a correctness concern.

## B10. Portability and target abstraction

Keleusma should eventually be portable across architectures from the 6502 to ARM64. This requires several substantial design extensions. The type system gains `word`, `byte`, `bit`, and `address` primitives whose sizes and alignments are target-defined. The compiler accepts a target descriptor as input. The runtime representation of `Value` becomes target-aware, with the current 64-bit-tagged-union form unsuitable for 8-bit and 16-bit targets. The block-structured ISA itself is target-portable in principle, with code generation backends producing target-specific assembly or machine code. The synchronous-language tradition uses a comparable approach in Lustre and SCADE, where target-independent intermediate representations feed into target-specific backends. Recorded for future conversation. This entry interacts with B5 (static strings), B9 (hot update of yielded static strings), and the precompiled-code question. The triple shares a common theme of cross-environment portability of Keleusma artifacts.

The precompiled-code question is partially addressed by R39 and the wire format established there. The bytecode loading API now accepts any addressable byte slice including `.rodata`. Full zero-copy execution from `.rodata` and the broader portability work remain open under P10 and this entry.
