# Backlog Decisions

> **Navigation**: [Decisions](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

Deferred decisions for future consideration. These are explicitly out of scope for the current development phase.

## B1. Hindley-Milner type inference

Full type inference would reduce annotation burden by allowing the compiler to deduce types from usage rather than requiring explicit declarations. Deferred due to implementation complexity and the current lack of generic types in the language.

## B2. Traits or generic type parameters

Traits or generic type parameters would enable polymorphic functions and reusable abstractions across different data types. Deferred to keep the VM and compiler simple during early development.

## B3. Closures or anonymous functions

Closures or anonymous functions would enable higher-order programming patterns such as callbacks and inline transformations. Deferred to keep the VM simple. Multiheaded function dispatch serves as a partial alternative for pattern-based dispatch.

## ~~B4. Hot code swap implementation~~ (Resolved as R29)

Hot code swap is implemented through `Vm::replace_module`. The host calls it between a `VmState::Reset` and the next `call`. The new module is verified before replacement. The host supplies an initial data segment instance whose length must match the new module's declared slot count. Frames and stack are cleared so the next `call` starts the new module's entry point. The same mechanism supports forward update and rollback. See R29 in [RESOLVED.md](./RESOLVED.md).

## ~~B5. Structural verification implementation~~ (Resolved as R22, R23)

Structural verification is implemented. See R22 and R23 in [RESOLVED.md](./RESOLVED.md).

## B5b. Static string discipline extensions

String values use the two-string-type discipline of `Value::StaticStr` and `Value::DynStr` with the host-owned arena boundary type `Value::KStr` for stale-pointer detection. The minimum coherent design is in place. Anything beyond, namely surface-language string concatenation, formatting, slicing, or other variable-cost operations, is deferred. Keleusma is not a value-add for string work, so further string features are recorded here for future consideration only.

## B6. String interpolation

String interpolation is not needed for a control language. Keleusma scripts primarily produce structured enum values and numeric outputs, not formatted strings. If formatting is needed, the host can provide native functions for string construction.

## B7. Error propagation through yield

Allowing yield to return `Result<T, E>` so the host can signal errors to the script would enable bidirectional error handling. Deferred due to type system complexity and the need to define error recovery semantics at the language level.

## B8. VM allocation model

Should the VM allocate per-script or share an arena across all active scripts? Currently each VM instance is independent with its own heap allocations. A shared arena could reduce allocation overhead for hosts running many concurrent scripts, but would add complexity to lifetime management.

## ~~B9. Hot update of yielded static strings~~ (Resolved structurally)

The lifetime concern is structurally avoided in the current implementation. `Value::from_const_archived` materializes archived `StaticStr` constants into owned `String` values at the moment they are pushed onto the operand stack. Yielded values that contain a `Value::StaticStr` therefore hold owned heap data that is independent of the bytecode buffer. A hot update that swaps the buffer through `Vm::replace_module` does not affect the host's retained yield value because the string bytes were already copied out at the lift boundary.

Eager resolution at the lift boundary is the resolution path B from the original design. The trade-off is a heap allocation per `StaticStr` push, which is acceptable for the dialogue surface where yielded values cross out of the VM. Future zero-copy yield paths that retain `&ArchivedString` references in `Value` would re-introduce the concern; if they are pursued, the host-responsibility model from path A is the alternative.

## B11. Per-op decode optimization for zero-copy execution

The zero-copy execution path reads each instruction through `op_from_archived(&chunk.ops[ip])`, which performs a discriminant match per fetch. The cost is one match arm and a small payload copy on hot loops. For very hot bytecode this could become measurable.

Two candidate optimizations.

A. Cache a decoded `Vec<Op>` per chunk at VM construction. Hot path becomes a direct slice index. Cost: heap allocation proportional to chunk size at construction; defeats zero-copy for the operation slice but preserves zero-copy for constants and string data.

B. Specialize the dispatch loop on a small set of hot opcodes through a separate dispatch table generated from the archived form. Cost: more complex codegen; benefit depends on opcode distribution in real workloads.

Deferred until profiling identifies the dispatch as a hot path on real workloads. The current implementation is correct and the cost is bounded by the structural verifier's per-op accounting, so this is a performance enhancement rather than a correctness concern.

## B10. Portability and target abstraction

Keleusma should eventually be portable across architectures from the 6502 to ARM64. This requires several substantial design extensions. The type system gains `word`, `byte`, `bit`, and `address` primitives whose sizes and alignments are target-defined. The compiler accepts a target descriptor as input. The runtime representation of `Value` becomes target-aware, with the current 64-bit-tagged-union form unsuitable for 8-bit and 16-bit targets. The block-structured ISA itself is target-portable in principle, with code generation backends producing target-specific assembly or machine code. The synchronous-language tradition uses a comparable approach in Lustre and SCADE, where target-independent intermediate representations feed into target-specific backends. Recorded for future conversation. This entry interacts with B5 (static strings), B9 (hot update of yielded static strings), and the precompiled-code question. The triple shares a common theme of cross-environment portability of Keleusma artifacts.

The precompiled-code question is partially addressed by R39 and the wire format established there. The bytecode loading API now accepts any addressable byte slice including `.rodata`. Full zero-copy execution from `.rodata` and the broader portability work remain open under P10 and this entry.
