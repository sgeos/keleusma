## Headline — the V0.2.x roadmap's Order-1 residual list was substantially STALE

Asked whether obvious roadmap work existed, the roadmap's own status claims were re-probed against the
code rather than relayed, because two stale claims had already surfaced the same day. **Four of six
Workstream A first-pass residuals were already CLOSED.** One previously unlisted gap was found.

**Already closed but still listed as open:**
- Module scaffold assembly — `self_host_compile_scratch` assembles data layout, enum table, signatures,
  schema hash, and the WCET/WCMU header with NO field borrowed from the reference.
- Integration into the shipping tool — the CLI's `self_hosted_compile` calls that scratch path.
- A conditional used as a call argument — byte-identical.
- A user-written `break;` statement — byte-identical inside `for … limit`.

**Genuinely open (the whole of what stands between here and the Order-1 gate):**
- The type checker in Keleusma (largest, highest risk — Hindley-Milner is not a streaming shape).
- The monomorphizer in Keleusma (near-identity over the subset).
- **Wire-format serialization** — no `.kel` stage references `to_bytes`, parity, or CRC; the framing
  header, operand-pool encoding, parity, and CRC trailer are all host-side.

**Newly identified, in no prior document:** the `for … limit … on { ok => …, break(bi) => …,
limit => … }` **outcome-arm** form DIVERGES from the reference. A bare `break;` self-hosts correctly, so
the gap is specifically the outcome-arm lowering and its index binding. Bounded and well-scoped.

## Also delivered — two more boundary pins

`eq/array_of_array` and `eq/enum_tuple_payload` were measured supported but UNGUARDED, and are now
pinned. Boundary **65 -> 67 Ok** (2 Gap / 1 RefRejects unchanged). No product code.

Their comment records a non-obvious **asymmetry**: array-of-array is supported but array-of-array inside
a STRUCT is not, and an enum TUPLE payload is supported while an enum ARRAY payload is not. Neither
generalizes to its enclosing-composite form, so support must not be inferred by analogy — probe it.

## Verification

- Every status claim above was established by differential probe against the reference, each run with a
  known-Gap CONTROL (`float_arith`) to prove the probe discriminates. A probe without a control is not
  evidence: `self_host_compile` builds on `compile_src` and replaces chunk bodies, so a skipped
  replacement would report identity trivially.
- The `for … on` divergence was isolated carefully: the first three attempts at the source were rejected
  by the REFERENCE (bad syntax on my part — the language has no `let mut`, and a `for` needs `limit`), a
  reference rejection is NOT a self-host gap, and the difference matters. Valid syntax was taken from
  `tests/for_limit.rs`. Bare `break;` then came out IDENTICAL and only the outcome-arm form diverged.
- Boundary test green at 67 Ok; full `scripts/release-gate.sh` result recorded in the commit message.

## Next step — continue the same-context queue (no operator prompt needed)

The per-frame accessor machinery this increment built is what the neighbouring gaps need, so the
loop's own ordering policy (context first) keeps it in this area. In order:

1. **array-of-tuple-of-struct** (`[(P, Word); 2]`) — reuses the accessor work directly.
2. **The impure-element subtree** just deferred here (`struct P { u: (Word, Word) }` inside a tuple):
   closing it means letting a frame's children be non-struct, which is the general mixed-subtree
   problem and the biggest remaining lever in this family.
3. **enum array payload / enum deep-struct payload / enum→struct→enum**, then array-of-array in a
   struct.

Do NOT prompt the operator to order these — that is settled by
[AUTONOMOUS_IMPLEMENTATION_LOOP.md](./AUTONOMOUS_IMPLEMENTATION_LOOP.md). Beyond this family, the
Order-1 gate still needs the type checker, the monomorphizer, and wire-format serialization.

## Standing method note

PROBE BEFORE PLANNING, always with a control, and **probe what the admission ACCEPTS, not only what
it rejects**. Both silent mis-compiles found so far (3-level struct, and this one) were in constructs
the admission happily accepted; a rejected construct fails loudly and is comparatively safe. When
generalizing a drain, tighten its admission IN THE SAME CHANGE: descending further without a matching
guard converts a shallow silent bug into a deeper one, which is exactly what happened mid-increment
here and was caught only because the impure cases were probed before the increment was declared done.
